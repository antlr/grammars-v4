# ABNF (BSD License) grammar

## Authors

Rainer Schuster, 2013

## Description

Augmented Backus–Naur Form (ABNF) is a metalanguage based on Backus–Naur form (BNF),
but consisting of its own syntax and derivation rules. The motive principle for
ABNF is to describe a formal system of a language to be used as a
bidirectional communications protocol.
