# TypeScript grammar

## Authors

* Andrii Artiushok (2019) - initial version

## Description

This TypeScript grammar does not exactly correspond to the TypeScript standard.
The main goal during developing was practical usage, performance, and clarity
(getting rid of duplicates).

The syntax is based on [JavaScript grammar](https://github.com/loonydev/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript)
by [Positive Technologies](https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies).

## Issues

* The grammar is very old and there are many ambiguities: primaryType Decision 11; singleExpression Decision 236; etc.
