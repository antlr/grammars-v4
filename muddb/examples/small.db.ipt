    You are in a dense mist that seems to go on forever. If you drop an object here, or set its home to be here, you probably won't be able to find it again. For some strange reason, you can sense which way is north here.

    You are at the top of a very deep fiery pit, into which robed, chanting priests throw offerings. A wide stone staircase descends toward the town square to the south. A small doorway opens north into the temple. You sense that it might be profitable to make a small sacrifice yourself.

    Volume Five, Dropto's
    \n
  description
   string
    When the '@link' command is used on a room, it sets a dropto location for that room. Any object dropped in the room (if it is not STICKY; cf. vol. 3) will go to that location. If the room is set to be STICKY, the effect of the dropto will be delayed until the last player leaves the room. The special location 'home' may be used as a dropto, as in '@link here = home'; in that case objects dropped in the room will go to their homes.

    Volume Four, Homes
    \n
  description
   string
    Every thing or player has a home. For things, this is the location the thing returns to when sacrificed, when a player carrying it goes home, or when (if STICKY) it is dropped. For players, this is where the player goes when issuing the 'home' command. Homes may be set using the '@link' command, e.g. '@link donut = <room-number>' or '@link me = <room-number>'. Exits may also be linked to the special location 'home', e.g. '@link north = home'.

    Volume Six, Recycling
    \n
  description
   string
    Nothing can be destroyed in TinyMUD. However, it is possible to recycle just about anything. The '@name' command can be used to rename objects, making it easy to turn a silk purse into a sow's ear or vice versa. Extra exits can be unlinked and picked up by their owner using the 'get' command, and dropped like ordinary objects using the 'drop' command in any room controlled by the dropper.
