Volume Two, Linkability
You can link to a room if you control it, or if the room is set to be LINK_OK. Being able to link to a room means that you can set the homes of objects (or yourself) to that room, and can set the destination of exits to that room. See the OED on "@link" for more info.

Volume Five, Dropto's
When the '@link' command is used on a room, it sets a dropto location for that room. Any object dropped in the room (if it is not STICKY; cf. vol. 3) will go to that location. If the room is set to be STICKY, the effect of the dropto will be delayed until the last player leaves the room. The special location 'home' may be used as a dropto, as in '@link here = home'; in that case objects dropped in the room will go to their homes.

Volume Four, Homes
Every thing or player has a home. For things, this is the location the thing returns to when sacrificed, when a player carrying it goes home, or when (if STICKY) it is dropped. For players, this is where the player goes when issuing the 'home' command. Homes may be set using the '@link' command, e.g. '@link donut = <room-number>' or '@link me = <room-number>'. Exits may also be linked to the special location 'home', e.g. '@link north = home'.

Nothing can be destroyed in TinyMUD. However, it is possible to recycle just about anything. The '@name' command can be used to rename objects, making it easy to turn a silk purse into a sow's ear or vice versa. Extra exits can be unlinked and picked up by their owner using the 'get' command, and dropped like ordinary objects using the 'drop' command in any room controlled by the dropper.
