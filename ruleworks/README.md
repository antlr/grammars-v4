This is the grammar for RuleWorks, which was intended as a follow on to OPS5. 
OPS5 was originally developed at Carnegie Melon University and then adopted
by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). The source code contains copyrights from 
DEC.

The late 1980's into the early 1990's were the age of expert systems. Digital 
Equipment rewrote OPS5 in Bliss (it was originally written in Lisp) and then 
wrote an expert system name XCON (for Expert Configurator.) If you ever saw a 
copy of the VMS hardware sales book you know why such an expert system was needed.

The software was obtained from VMS Software, Inc (VSI) freeware site.

Below is the opening paragraph from the freeware_readme.txt file included with
the software.

***************************************************************************
RuleWorks is a language, compiler (with debugger), and Run-Time Library for
constructing high performance, modular, object-oriented, forward-chaining,
rules-based applications.  (RuleWorks is an evolutionary step past OPS5.)
It provides portability by producing ANSI C sources which can then be 
compiled with any of the leading C or C++ compilers. There is a Run-Time 
Library for each supported platform and C compiler.

The email bounces back with "the domain ruleworks.co.uk couldn't be found."

Not too surprising given that the source code files are 25 years old.

The examples directory contains 3 sample programs. The one of interest (advent) is
an incomplete port of the Adventure program that made the rounds in the early 
1980's. All 3 programs parse cleanly.
