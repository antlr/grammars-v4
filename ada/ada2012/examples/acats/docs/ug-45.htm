<H1>4.5 General Standards</H1>
<div class="Normal">ACATS tests were developed to a general set of standards. 
To promote a variety of code styles and usage idioms in the tests, standards 
were not necessarily rigorously enforced but were used as guidelines 
for test writers. A maximum line length of 79 characters was used to 
enhance electronic distribution of tests (except when specific testing 
requirements dictated otherwise, usually in .dep and .tst files). Tests 
tend to be about 120 executable lines long, though many tests deviate 
from this norm (either longer or shorter) to achieve a design that focuses 
on the objective and a readable, maintainable test. Sometimes complex 
objectives have been divided into sub-objectives to achieve complete 
coverage in comprehensible, maintainable tests. Some tests check multiple 
objectives; in other cases, sub-objectives are checked in separate tests.</div>
<div class="Normal">Legacy tests use only the basic 55-character set 
(26 capital letters, 10 digits, and 19 punctuation marks). Unless there 
is a specific test requirement, numeric values are in the range (-2048..2047), 
which can be represented in 12 bits. Numeric values are generally in 
the range (-128..127). Modern tests use both upper and lower case letters 
and may use larger numeric values (but within the range (-65536..65535) 
except in rare cases).</div>
<div class="Normal">Legacy tests tend to use as few Ada features as necessary 
to write a self-checking executable test that can be read and maintained. 
Modern tests tend to exhibit a usage-oriented style, employing a rich 
assortment and interaction of features and exemplifying the kind of code 
styles and idioms that compilers may encounter in practice.</div>
<div class="Normal">In modern tests, Ada reserved words are entirely 
in lower case. Identifiers normally have their initial letter capitalized. 
Every attempt has been made to choose meaningful identifiers. In B class 
tests, identifier names often provide a clue to the specific case or 
situation under test. In C class tests, identifiers are normally chosen 
to help document the test design or the intent of the code.</div>
<div class="Normal">Modern executable tests generally provide some visual 
separation of those test elements that focus on conformance issues from 
those that govern the flow of a test. For example, there is frequently 
a need to establish preconditions for a test and examine post-conditions 
after a section of test code has executed. To distinguish between constructs 
(types, objects, etc.) that are part of the test code and those that 
are artifacts of the testing process (e.g., pre-, post-conditions), the 
latter have <TT>TC_</TT> prefixed to the identifier name. This prefix 
is shorthand for <TT>Test_Control</TT>.</div>
