<H1>5.3.2 "CZ" Acceptance Tests</H1>
<div class="Normal">Four tests having names beginning &quot;CZ&quot; 
are part of the ACATS suite. Unlike other tests in the suite, they do 
not focus on Ada language features. Instead, they are intended primarily 
to verify that software needed for the correct execution of the test 
suite works as expected and required. They check, for example, to see 
that package Report and package TCTouch work correctly.</div>
<div class="Normal">All CZ tests must execute correctly and exhibit the 
prescribed behavior for a successful conformity assessment. CZ tests 
must be processed and run as the first step of a conformity assessment 
to ensure correct operation of the support software.</div>
<div class="Normal">The acceptance test CZ1101A tests the correct operation 
of the reporting facilities of package Report, including checks that 
Not_Applicable and Failed calls are reported properly, and that premature 
calls cause failure. Therefore, CZ1101A will print some failure messages 
when it is executed. The presence of these messages does <I>not</I> necessarily 
mean the test has failed. A listing of the expected output for CZ1101A 
is included in <A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Annex C</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Results 
of CZ Tests</A>&rdquo; (times and dates in the actual output will differ).</div>
<div class="Normal">The acceptance test CZ1102A tests the correct operation 
of the dynamic value routines in Report. This test should report &quot;PASSED&quot;; 
any other result constitutes a test failure.</div>
<div class="Normal">The acceptance test CZ1103A ensures the correct operation 
of procedure Checkfile. (Some of the executable file I/O tests use a 
file checking procedure named Checkfile that determines an implementation's 
text file characteristics. The source code for this procedure is in the 
file checkfil.ada.) CZ1103A checks whether errors in text files are properly 
detected, therefore, CZ1103A will print some failure messages when it 
is executed. The presence of these messages does <I>not</I> necessarily 
mean the test has failed. A listing of the expected output for CZ1103A 
is included in <A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Annex C</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Results 
of CZ Tests</A>&rdquo; (times and dates in the actual output will differ).</div>
<div class="Normal">The acceptance test CZ00004 produces output that 
verifies the intent of the conformity assessment. It relies on ImpDef 
having been correctly updated for the conformity assessment and produces 
output identifying the annexes (if any) that will be included as part 
of the conformity assessment. This test also checks for the proper operation 
of the TCTouch package, includes checks that assertion failures are reported 
properly, therefore CZ00004 will print some failure messages when it 
is executed. The presence of these messages does <I>not</I> necessarily 
mean the test has failed. A listing of the expected output for CZ00004 
is included in <A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Annex C</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="UG-C.HTM">Results 
of CZ Tests</A>&rdquo;; since this output includes values from the customized 
impdef, non-failure lines may vary from those in the expected output. 
However, the number of lines and their relative positions should not 
change (only the contents of the lines can change).</div>
