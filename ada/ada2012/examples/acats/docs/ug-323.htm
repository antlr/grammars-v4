<H1>3.2.3 Coverage Guidelines for Specific Rule Categories</H1>
<div class="Normal" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em">The Ada standard is 
divided into various categories of rules. These rule categories have 
different requirements and thus differ in what is the appropriate testing 
philosophy. This translates into different types of test objectives for 
each rule category.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Uncategorized text:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
This is generally introductory text, and does not require any testing. 
This text sometimes includes definitions; these are handled as described 
in <A HREF="UG-322.HTM">3.2.2</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="UG-322.HTM">General 
Coverage Guidelines</A>&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Syntax:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Testing that legal syntax is implemented is accomplished by all of the 
other kinds of tests, especially by the usage-oriented tests. Generally, 
tests for illegal syntax have a very low value. Most compilers use a 
syntax that is similar to that of the standard, and many use parsers 
generated by tools, and thus the likelihood of errors is low. Moreover, 
the number of possible bugs is essentially unlimited. There are three 
cases where testing is warranted: First, rules that are given in text 
form rather than BNF are treated as legality rules (see below). Second, 
the Ada syntax grammar is not directly usable by either of the common 
technologies for parsers (LL/recursive descent, and LR/LALR). In cases 
where the grammar used by a compiler must necessarily be more general 
than that given in the standard, the additional requirements are treated 
as legality rules. Finally, an irregularity in the syntax rules can suggest 
an obvious (but incorrecct) syntax extension. It can warrant a test that 
such an extension is not implemented. For instance, most places in Ada 
that declare an object allow the use of subtype_indications, but subprogram 
profiles only allow subtype_marks. It should be tested that subtype_indications 
are not allowed when declaring parameters, even though this is a syntax 
rule.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Name Resolution Rules:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Name resolution rules should usually have a B-Test that checks that too 
much information is not used for resolution. (For instance, whether a 
type is limited or non-limited should generally not be used. Another 
example is whether an access type is pool-specific or general access 
usually should not be used.) It also may have a C-Test to check that 
legal cases are allowed; but this objective is often handled by tests 
for other test objectives (if that's the case, a note should point out 
where they are tested). One common case where a C-Test is needed occurs 
when a name resolution rule uses some property for resolution. In this 
case, a C-Test that the property can be used to resolve an overloaded 
function call is needed. (For instance, an if statement condition must 
be of a Boolean type; it should be tested that a function returning some 
other type is ignored when resolving a condition.)</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Legality Rules:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Legality rules should almost always have an associated B-Test that checks 
that illegal cases are detected. They may also have a C-Test to check 
that legal cases are allowed; again, this is often handled by tests for 
other test objectives. (They also can be covered in the B-Test with &quot;OK&quot; 
cases.)</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Static Semantics:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Many Static Semantic rules are definitions, and as such can be handled 
as described in <A HREF="UG-322.HTM">3.2.2</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="UG-322.HTM">General 
Coverage Guidelines</A>&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term"></div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Many other static semantic rules are miscategorized by the standard. 
For instance, most of the library packages are defined as static semantics, 
even though most of the rules are really dynamic. These should be tested 
as appropriate for the correct category.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term"></div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Remaining rules should be tested as legality rules (arguably, these too 
are miscategorized).</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Post-Compilation Rules:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
A post-compilation rule should always have L-Tests to check that the 
check is made in illegal cases. These checks are especially likely to 
be omitted (because they're often complex to implement), so these tests 
should have a high priority. In some cases, a C-Test may be needed to 
ensure that legal cases work and the check does not go too far. Often 
that will be covered by other tests, so a separate test is not needed 
(a note should be provided to show where it is covered).</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Dynamic Semantics:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Dynamic semantics rules can be divided into two sub-categories.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term"></div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
First, these rules can define run-time checks. These checks should have 
C-Tests that verify that the check is made and the appropriate exception 
is raised. Tests like this have to be carefully constructed to avoid 
running afoul of 11.6 permissions.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term"></div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
Otherwise, these rules can define the normal operation of a construct. 
These should have usage-oriented C-Tests. By making these tests usage-oriented, 
the ACATS tests the normal usage of these features, not unusual corner-cases.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term"></div><div class="WideHanging-Body">
One special case: rules that say the execution of something &quot;has 
no effect&quot; can't be usefully tested. Testing that nothing happens 
is not interesting. And testing for the absence of an effect requires 
guessing incorrect effects that might have occurred (which is unlikely 
to actually detect anything), and thus any such test would have a very 
low value.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Bounded (Run-Time) Errors:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
These usually require C-Tests, but not always. If the bound includes 
&quot;work normally&quot;, then the bounded error is not usefully testable, 
since the ACATS does not test implementation choices. Whether something 
works or raises Program_Error is not interesting. In other cases, however, 
since there is a bound on the behavior, it can be useful to ensure that 
one of the prescribed results happens rather than havoc.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Erroneous Execution:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
This is not testable. Since the language allows anything to happen, there 
is no useful information to be gained from including this in a test. 
Indeed, it's important to avoid any such case in an executable test.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Implementation Requirements:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
These usually are dynamic requirements that should be tested like the 
appropriate dynamic semantics rules. Otherwise, they should be tested 
like a legality rule.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Implementation Permissions:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Usually permissions are not testable. Since the ACATS is not testing 
the quality of implementations, the choices made by an implementation 
are not appropriate things to test. So a test should be created only 
if there is value in testing for implementations exceeding the permission.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Implementation Advice:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
Advice is usually not testable. Again, since the ACATS is not testing 
quality of implementations, the choices made by an implementation are 
not appropriate things to test. Moreover, advice need not be followed, 
and other implementation choices can be made. Usually, if there are bounds 
to what is acceptable, they are covered by other rules, and thus the 
tests would be there.</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Documentation Requirements and Metrics:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
No tests are required for documentation requirements. Documentation existence 
could be part of the conformity assessment process, but in any case it 
is outside of the scope of the ACATS (which is testing the implementation, 
not the documentation).</div>
<div class="WideHanging-Term">Notes and Examples:</div><div class="WideHanging-Body"><br clear="left">
These are non-normative text, and do not require any testing.</div>
