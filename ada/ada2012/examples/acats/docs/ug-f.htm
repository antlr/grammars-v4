disagreement with the test objective, test code, test grading criteria, 
or result of processing an ACATS test program when the result is not 
PASSED or INAPPLICABLE according to the established grading criteria. 
A challenge is submitted to the ACAA.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1086"></A><B>Conforming implementation.</B> 
An implementation that produces an acceptable result for every applicable 
test. Any deviation constitutes a non-conformity.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1087"></A><B>Core language.</B> Clauses 
2-13 and Annexes A, B, and J of <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A>. 
All implementations are required to implement the core language. The 
tests for core language features are required of all implementations.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1088"></A><B>Coverage documents.</B> Documents 
containing an analysis of every paragraph of the Ada Standard documents. 
Each paragraph has an indication of whether it contains a testable Ada 
requirement, and if so, suggested test objectives to cover the requirements 
of the paragraphs. Paragraphs that include objectives also indicate what 
ACATS test(s) specifically test those objectives.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1089"></A><B>Deviation.</B> Failure of 
an Ada implementation to produce an acceptable result when processing 
an ACATS test program.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1090"></A><B>Event Trace.</B> A list of 
interesting events that occurs during the compilation, binding/linking, 
and execution of one or more ACATS tests. An abstraction of the implementation-specific 
details used by the grading tool.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1091"></A><B>Foundation Code.</B> Code 
used by multiple tests; foundation code is designed to be reusable. Generally 
a foundation is a package containing types, variables, and subprograms 
that are applicable and useful to a series of related tests. Foundation 
code is never expected to cause compile time errors. It may be compiled 
once for all tests that use it or recompiled for each test that uses 
it; it must be bound with each test that uses it.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1092"></A><B>Grading Tool.</B> A tool to 
automate grading of ACATS tests. Uses an event trace and test summary 
to determine the pass or fail results of ACATS tests.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1093"></A><B>Legacy Tests.</B> Tests that 
were included in ACVC 1.12 that have been incorporated into later ACVC 
and ACATS versions. The vast majority of these tests check for language 
features that are upwardly compatible from <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">[Ada83]</A> 
to later versions of Ada. Some of these tests have been modified from 
the ACVC 1.12 versions to ensure that Ada rules are properly implemented 
in cases where there were extensions or incompatibilities from <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">[Ada83]</A> 
to later versions of Ada.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1094"></A><B>Modern Tests.</B> Tests that 
have been constructed and added to the ACATS since the release of ACVC 
1.12. These tests usually test features added to Ada since <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada83">[Ada83]</A>. 
Modern tests have a coding style more like that used by typical programmers 
than the Legacy tests, and have a different naming convention.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1095"></A><B>Range indicator.</B> A range 
indicator provides detailed information about the expected location of 
an error; tests using range indicators can be graded more accurately 
by the grading tool.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1096"></A><B>Specialized Needs Annex.</B> 
(Abbreviated <B>SNA</B>) One of annexes C through H of <A HREF="UG-01.HTM#Ada95">[Ada95]</A>. 
Conformity testing against one or more Specialized Needs Annexes is optional. 
There are tests that apply to each of the Specialized Needs Annexes. 
Results of processing these tests (if processed during a conformity assessment) 
are reported on the certificate and in the Certified Processors List.<A NAME="I1097"></A></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1098"></A><B>Test Objective.</B> The intended 
purpose of an ACATS test. A test objective ought to be relatable to rules 
given in the Standards that define Ada.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1099"></A><B>Test Objectives Document.</B> 
A document containing the test objectives used for Modern ACATS tests. 
Information on Legacy tests is not included.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1100"></A><B>Test Summary.</B> A list of 
information about one or more ACATS tests, describing the test requirements 
to the grading tool.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1101"></A><B>Validated Compilers List.</B> 
(Abbreviated <B>VCL</B>) Former designation of the Certified Processors 
List.<A NAME="I1102"></A></div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1103"></A><B>Validated Implementation.</B> 
Informally used to mean Conforming Implementation.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1104"></A><B>Validation.</B>  Informally 
used to mean conformity assessment.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1105"></A><B>Withdrawn Test.</B> A test 
found to be incorrect and not used in conformity testing. A test may 
be incorrect because it has an invalid test objective, fails to meet 
its test objective, or contains erroneous or illegal use of the Ada programming 
language. Withdrawn tests are not applicable to any implementation. Withdrawn 
tests are often modified and restored to subsequent ACATS releases.</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1106"></A><B>Witness Testing.</B> Conformity 
assessment testing performed in the presence of ACAL personnel. Witness 
testing adds the assurance that the test procedures were followed and 
that the results were verified.</div>
