<H1>Annex E<BR>
Guidelines for Test Development</H1>
<div class="Normal">The guidelines used for developing recent ACATS tests 
are summarized in this Annex. Developers of potential ACATS tests should 
follow these guidelines closely. Tests that deviate extensively from 
these guidelines are far less likely to be added to the ACATS than those 
that follow them carefully.</div>
<div class="Bulleted" style="margin-bottom: 0.3em">Tests should follow 
the test structure and organization of existing ACATS tests. Many details 
of existing tests are described elsewhere in this document. Important 
topics include:</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Test classes (see <A HREF="UG-42.HTM">4.2</A>);</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Test naming conventions (see <A HREF="UG-432.HTM">4.3.2</A> 
and <A HREF="UG-433.HTM">4.3.3</A>);</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Test layout and prologue (see <A HREF="UG-44.HTM">4.4</A>);</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Identifier and reserved word conventions 
(see <A HREF="UG-45.HTM">4.5</A>);</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Library unit naming within tests 
(see <A HREF="UG-433.HTM">4.3.3</A>);</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Executable test structure (see <A HREF="UG-46.HTM">4.6</A>); 
and</div>
<div class="Indented2NestedBulleted">Indication of errors in B and L 
tests (see <A HREF="UG-46.HTM">4.6</A>).</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Submitted tests should be include the standard 
ACAA &quot;Grant of Unlimited Rights&quot; (found in most newer tests 
issued since 2010) or an equivalent release allowing the test to be freely 
used by anyone. Under no circumstances should submitted tests contain 
proprietary information or code. Submitted tests without such a grant 
cannot be included in the ACATS or even the submitted tests directory.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">The test number (character positions 6 and 7) should 
be assigned letters rather than numbers by submitting test authors. Letters 
that are likely to be unique (such as the author's initials) are preferred. 
(Of course, different tests for the same clause with the same author 
should have different names.) The ACAA Technical Agent will perform the 
final naming of tests in order to ensure that the names are unique and 
appropriate. Following this guideline reduces the chance of test conflicts 
between authors.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">If a single test file contains multiple compilation 
units, they should be given in an order such that any dependent units 
follow the units they depend on (so an implementation can process the 
units sequentially in order). However, it should be assumed that all 
units in a file will be presented to the compiler simultaneously. If 
a test requires units to be presented in a specific order (as some separate 
compilation tests do), the units with ordering requirements should be 
in separate files, and the required order should be documented in the 
test prologue.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When possible for B-Tests, only the last unit in 
a file should contain errors (or even better, units with errors should 
be in separate files from those without errors). This avoids penalizing 
implementations that process units in a file sequentially and stop on 
the first bad unit. (Multiple units in a single file are fairly rare 
in real user code; the ACATS shouldn't require work in areas not useful 
to typical users.) This guideline should be violated only when the number 
of units with errors would be prohibitive to have in separate files. 
(The maximum number of separate files in a test is 36 plus any foundations, 
because the naming conventions for tests only leave a single character 
for sequence numbers.)</div>
<div class="Bulleted">C-Tests (especially those testing rules that are 
not runtime checks) should be written in a usage-oriented style. That 
means that the tests should reflect the way the features are typically 
used in practice. Using a feature with no context is discouraged. For 
instance, C-Tests for <B>limited with</B> clauses should use them to 
declare mutually dependent types (the reason that <B>limited with</B> 
clauses were added to the language) rather than just using them to replace 
regular <B>with</B> clauses.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Tests should avoid the use of Text_IO (unless required 
by the test objective). In particular, C-Tests should not create messages 
with Text_IO; all messages should be generated via the subprograms in 
the Report package. Messages in C-Tests should be written in mixed case, 
not all UPPER CASE. Failure messages should be unique, so that the exact 
failure can be pinpointed. This is often accomplished by including a 
subtest identifier in the messages.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Executable tests should not call routines in Report 
(directly, or indirectly via another package like TCTouch or Check_File) 
before the call to Report.Test or after the call to Report.Result. Doing 
so could cause an individual report (Comment, Failure, and so on) to 
not properly identify the test, or for the overall test result to be 
incorrectly reported. This does not apply to the various functions defined 
in Report with the exception of Legal_File_Name; these can be used freely 
in a test. It also does not apply to TCTouch.Touch.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Tests can combine multiple objectives if a test 
for a single objective is very short. However, the objectives should 
be related, and the number of objectives in a test should be limited 
(to avoid creating gigantic tests that are hard to understand and use). 
In particular, objectives should not be combined if in doing so, the 
test will exceed 500 lines. Objectives from different clauses should 
never be combined, as that makes it hard to find the associated test 
(it will necessarily be filed in the wrong clause for one of the objectives).</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When possible, tests should define (and thus share) 
foundation code (see <A HREF="UG-414.HTM">4.1.4</A>). Foundation packages 
are a better alternative than creating large tests with many objectives 
when the primary reason for combining the objectives is to avoid writing 
set-up code multiple times. Foundation code is specific to tests for 
a particular clause, however, so this technique cannot be used to combine 
objectives from multiple clauses.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When a rule includes a term defined elsewhere, 
testing of the rule should include testing all of the combinations implied 
by the term. For instance, if we have a definition like &quot;something 
is either this, that, or fuzzy&quot;, then a test for a test objective 
involving something should test cases where something is this and that 
and fuzzy. If multiple layers of definitions make this impractical, then 
a wide selection of combinations (as different as possible) should be 
tried. The only exception to this rule is if separate tests of the definition 
exist or should exist (that is, there is a test objective to test that 
the definition is appropriately implemented).</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When appropriate, tests should try a variety of 
things. For instance, when testing subprograms, both procedures and functions 
should be tested, with varying numbers of parameters, and with different 
modes and types. Similarly, types should be more than just Integer &ndash; 
tagged types, tasks, protected types, and anonymous access types should 
be tried. However, adding variety should not be used as an excuse to 
create multiple tests for an objective when one will do. That is, variety 
is a secondary goal; exhaustive coverage of possibilities isn't needed 
(unless the testing includes testing a term defined elsewhere, as described 
in the previous guideline). Remember that the goal isn't to test combinations 
of features; the point of using variety is to ensure that the objective 
being tested works in more than just the simplest cases.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Tests should generally use only the 7-bit ASCII 
characters. However, some tests will need to use other characters in 
order to test Wide_Wide_Character support, Unicode characters in identifiers, 
and the like. Such tests should be encoded in UTF-8 and start with a 
UTF-8 Byte Order Mark. Tests should only use the code points that were 
assigned in version 4.0 of the Unicode standard; when possible, using 
only commonly used characters such as Greek and Cyrillic characters is 
preferred. (Such characters are more likely to be present in the fonts 
available to ACATS users; users will be more likely to be able to view 
the tests as intended if common characters are used.)</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When constructing tests that check to see that 
run-time checks are made, take special care that 10.2.1 and 11.6 permissions 
don't render the test impotent. 11.6(5) allows language-defined checks 
to be optimized away if the result of the operation is not used (even 
if the exception is handled). Similarly, 10.2.1(18/3) allows calls to 
subprograms in Pure packages to be omitted if the result of the operation 
is not used. That means it is critical that the values that fail checks 
are used in some way afterwards (even though a correct program will never 
execute that code). Failure to do that could allow a compiler to optimize 
the entire test away, and that would require the test to be corrected 
later.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">When creating a B-Test for which different parts 
test different errors, each error should identify the intended failure. 
The standard error indication includes a colon; any needed text can follow 
that colon. If the error identification will not fit on one line, place 
it somewhere else and index to it. One common way to do this is to put 
a list of intended errors into the header, labeling each with a letter. 
Then each error comment can just identify the letter of the intended 
error.</div>
<div class="Bulleted">Tests that cover test objectives that are documented 
as untested are especially welcome as test submissions. Tests that cover 
previously tested objectives are less likely to be included in the test 
suite.</div>
<div class="Normal">Submitted tests can be sent to the ACAA Technical 
Agent (<A HREF="mailto:agent@ada-auth.org">agent@ada-auth.org</A>) via 
e-mail; include a subject of &quot;Submitted ACATS Test&quot; in your 
e-mail. The agent will attempt to work with all submitters to correct 
critical definencies, and will attempt to publicly add tests to the submitted 
tests index in a timely fashion. However, there can be no promise that 
submitted tests (or a similar test for a similar objective) will ever 
be added to the ACATS.&nbsp;</div>
