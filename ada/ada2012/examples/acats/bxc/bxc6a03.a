--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that if a volatile type is used as an actual for a generic
--     formal derived type, the ancestor of the formal type must not be a
--     non-volatile by-reference type.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     A volatile type is one to which a pragma Volatile or Atomic applies.
--
--     A volatile object is any of the following:
--
--        (1) An object to which a pragma Volatile applies.
--        (2) A component of an array to which a pragma Volatile_Components
--            applies.
--        (3) An object of a volatile type (i.e., a type to which a pragma
--            Volatile applies).
--        (4) An object to which a pragma Atomic applies.
--        (5) A component of an array to which a pragma Atomic_Components
--            applies.
--        (6) An object of a atomic type (i.e., a type to which a pragma
--            Atomic applies).
--        (7) A subcomponent of a volatile object.
--
--     A by-reference type is a descendant of any of the following:
--
--        (1) A tagged type.
--        (2) A task type.
--        (3) A protected type.
--        (4) A non-private type with the word "limited" in its declaration.
--        (5) A composite type with a subcomponent of a by-reference type.
--        (6) A private type whose full type is a by-reference type.
--
--     This test attempts to use various types as actuals for generic formal
--     derived types, where the ancestor of each formal derived type is a
--     volatile type. The test verifies that an instantiation is illegal if
--     the actual type is a non-volatile, by-reference type.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--
--         FXC6A00.A
--      -> BXC6A03.A
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--      This test is only applicable for implementations validating the
--      Systems Programming Annex.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      01 Feb 96   SAIC    Initial version for ACVC 2.1.
--      25 Aug 96   SAIC    Added additional cases. Corrected prologue.
--      02 Dec 97   EDS     Removed application of Pragma Volatile to
--                          type Volatile_Private.
--      27 Aug 99   RLB     Repaired test comments.
--      05 Feb 18   RLB     Commented out test case changed by AI05-0218-1.
--                          Added error location indicators.
--      06 Feb 18   RLB     Replaced test case, requiring AI05-0218-1 behavior.
