--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--
--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a child unit cannot be named in a private with_clause by its
--    simple name or any abbreviated form of its full name. (10.1.6(2/2)).
--
--    Check that a unit nested in a library package cannot be named
--    in a nonlimited_with_clause. (10.1.6(2/2)).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--    Declare an example of every kind of library unit, and try to use
--    them in a limited with. Use some children and some root units.
--
--    Note: The second objective was not tested in ACATS 2.x, so we
--    test both private with and regular withs.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    28 Mar 2006   RLB    Created test from BA16001.
