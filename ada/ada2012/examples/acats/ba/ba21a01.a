--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that an instantiation of a generic library package declaration
--      to which a pragma Preelaborate applies is illegal if the instantiation
--      occurs within a library package declaration to which a pragma
--      Preelaborate also applies, and the generic library package contains
--      any of the following constructs in its visible or private part (such
--      that the construct is evaluated upon instantiation):
--
--         (a) A call to a nonstatic function.
--         (b) A call to a formal function, if the corresponding actual
--             is a nonstatic function.
--         (c) A primary that is a name of an object, if the name is not a
--             static expression and does not statically denote a discriminant
--             of an enclosing type.
--         (d) A declaration of a default-initialized object of a type that
--             does not have preelaborable initialization.
--         (e) An extension aggregate with an ancestor subtype mark denoting
--             a subtype that does not have preelaborable initialization.
--
--      Check that each of the constructs above is legal within the visible
--      or private part of a generic library package declaration to which a
--      pragma Preelaborate applies, as well as within a corresponding
--      instance to which a pragma Preelaborate does not apply.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      A default-initialized object is one which is not explicitly
--      initialized (the presence of default expressions is irrelevant).
--
--      Since the elaboration of a generic declaration has no effect,
--      constructs which are illegal in other units to which a pragma
--      Preelaborate applies are legal in a generic declaration. An
--      instantiation of such a generic, however, may or may not be legal
--      depending on whether a pragma Preelaborate applies to it. The
--      pragma only applies to an instance if it is explicitly provided
--      for the instance (the pragma in a generic does not automatically
--      apply to its instances).
--
--      Declare various supporting types, objects, and subprograms in a
--      preelaborated package declaration (foundation code). Verify the
--      legality of each of the constructs above in the visible or private
--      part of an individual preelaborated generic library package
--      declaration (that is, place each of the constructs above in
--      its own generic package). Verify that a library-level instance of
--      each of these generic packages is legal if a pragma Preelaborate
--      does not apply to it.
--
--      Declare a preelaborated library level package, and within it verify
--      that instantiations of each of the generic packages are illegal.
--      Instantiate in both the visible and private part of the package.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      The following files comprise this test:
--
--         FA21A00.A
--         BA21A01.A
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      30 Mar 95   SAIC    Initial prerelease version.
--      08 May 95   SAIC    Modified objective wording.
--      26 Oct 07   RLB     Updated the test objective, description, and
--                          expected errors to use the preelaborable
--                          initialization description from Amendment 1.
--      26 Apr 21   RLB     Added error location indicators.
