--                                     Notice
--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE
--     Check that private child subprograms must have a specification.
--     Check that package bodies cannot be declared private.
--     Check that subunits cannot be declared private.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION
--     This is technically a syntax test, which we usually don't test.
--     However, the Ada grammar requires two token lookahead to
--     differentiate between a private with clause and the start of a
--     private unit. A two token lookahead is beyond the
--     capabilities of most automated parser generators. Thus, it is likely
--     that this check will be implemented outside of the syntax; in that
--     case it would be easy to omit.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BA110130.A
--         BA110131.A
--         BA110132.A
--         BA110133.A
--         BA110134.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files BA110131.A, BA110132.A, and BA110133.A contain errors.
--      All errors in these files must be detected to pass the test. Compiling
--      the body file BA110134.AM (which contains two bodies) is optional.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      21 Mar 2007   RLB   Created test from submitted test.
--      13 Feb 2018   RLB   Updated Pass/Fail criteria to note that processing
--                          the last source file is optional (it is unnecessary
--                          to test the objective). Added error location
--                          indicators.
