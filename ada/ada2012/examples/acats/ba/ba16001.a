--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that library subprograms, generic units, and library renames
--    of them cannot be mentioned in a limited_with_clause. (10.1.6(2/2);
--    this is repeated in 10.1.2(17/2)).
--
--    Check that a package nested in a library package cannot be mentioned
--    in a limited_with_clause. (10.1.6(2/2)).
--
--    Check that a child unit cannot be named in a limited_with_clause by its
--    simple name or any abbreviated form of its full name. (10.1.6(2/2)).
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--    Declare an example of every kind of library unit, and try to use
--    them in a limited with. Use some children and some root units.
--    Also use a few limited private withs to check that the rules are
--    checked for them, too.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    29 Nov 2004   PHL    Initial version.
--    26 Mar 2006   RLB    Created test from submitted test.
