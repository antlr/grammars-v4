--
--    The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--    Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--    with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--    assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--    to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--    ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a compilation unit is illegal if it depends on an earlier
--    version of itself. Part 2: private with.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--    This checks the last portion of 10.1.4(5). This rule essentially says
--    that a compilation unit cannot with itself, directly or indirectly.
--
--    As is usual for clause 10 tests, the source files after the first
--    represent later edits of the source code by the programmer. Test
--    scripts need to take care that the files are presented to the compiler
--    one at a time, not all at the same time.
--
--    We test mostly specifications that don't require bodies, but we use
--    subprogram bodies to ensure that replacement is not involved. Note that
--    there is no significant use for a private with on a subprogam
--    specification (of any kind), a renames or a generic instantiation
--    so we don't test such cases.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BA140020.A
--         BA140021.A
--         BA140022.A
--         BA140023.A
--         BA140024.A
--         BA140025.A
--         BA140026.A
--         BA140027.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files BA140021.A, BA140022.A, BA140023.A, BA140024.A, BA140025.A,
--      BA140026.A, and BA140027.A contain errors. All errors in these files
--      must be detected to pass the test.
--      Compiling the generic subprogram body BA14002H is optional.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    15 Feb 2018  RLB  Created test from test BA14001.
