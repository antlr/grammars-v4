--                                     Notice
--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that a tagged partial view and its completion must have
--      the same set of interfaces.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      We declare a variety of interfaces and types with those interfaces,
--      then make sure that the completions have exactly the same set of
--      interfaces. We try each kind of completion.
--
--      This test is checking 7.3(7.3/2), the so-called "no hidden interfaces"
--      rule (but the rule also requires "no missing interfaces" as well).
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      07 Jun 05   H K     Initial version.
--      30 Dec 13   RLB     Created from three submitted tests and several
--                          additional cases.
--      22 Apr 21   RLB     Added error location indicators.
