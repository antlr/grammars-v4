--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that the visible components of a type extension are only those
--      inherited from the parent type, even if additional components of an
--      ancestor type are visible.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      There are several ways to trigger this rule.
--
--      Declare a tagged private type Root, with components I and C.
--
--      Subtest 1:
--      Declare Bar, a private extension of Root, in a child package, with
--      component B.
--      Declare Dock, a private extension of Root, in a child package of Root's
--      package, with a component C of a different type than Root's C.
--      Check that within the body of Dock's package, the new C component is
--      visible, but Root's I and C components, and Bar's B component, are not
--      visible.
--
--      Subtest 2:
--      Declare Tool, a visible extension of Root, in a non-child package, with
--      component B.
--      Declare Hammer, a visible extension of Root, in a child package of
--      Root's package, with component D.
--      Check that within Hammer's package, components B and D are visible, but
--      not C.
--
--      These requirements were confirmed by AI-00157.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B7300060.A
--         B7300061.A
--         B7300062.A
--         B7300063.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files B7300061.A and B7300062.A contain errors. All errors in these
--      files must be detected to pass the test.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      14 Sep 99   RLB     Created test.
--      02 Feb 17   RLB     Fixed overlong line.
