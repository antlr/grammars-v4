-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that if the ancestor subtype of a private extension
--     has constrained discriminants, then the parent subtype of
--     the full view imposes a statically matching constraint
--     on those discriminants.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--
--     Declare various type extensions that have constraints and check
--     that static matching is required.
--     Note that constraints that depend on the discriminants of a view
--     are never static. If those are explicitly given on a private extension,
--     no completion could ever be legal (the constraints given on the
--     completion are not static and are different, thus they can never
--     statically match). In this case, we allow rejecting the
--     private extension declaration (marked as an "Possible Error" in the
--     test) instead of the completion.
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     The test contains several lines marked POSSIBLE ERROR: [Setnn].
--     For each value of n, the implementation must detect one or more of
--     these possible errors. For instance, an error must be detected on
--     at least one of the lines labeled POSSIBLE ERROR: [Set1] for an
--     implementation to pass.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     06 Sep 02   DRE   Created test.
--     30 May 13   RLB   Changes for issuance: created main subprogram,
--                       adjusted capitalization, improved objective wording,
--                       explained errors, added derived test cases.
--     22 Apr 21   RLB   Fixed overlong lines, header formatting issues.
--                       Added error location indicators.
