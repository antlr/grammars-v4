--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the full constant declaration that completes a deferred
--     constant declaration can only occur in the private part of the same
--     package.
--
--     Check that a deferred constant declaration completed with a full
--     constant declaration can only be given in the visible part of a
--     package specification.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     The objective of test B740001 may appear to cover these cases,
--     but the actual test does not. Nor do any legacy tests cover these
--     objectives.
--
--     This test declares deferred constants of various types
--     in the visible part of a package specification, and completes the
--     them with full constant declarations in various places. The test
--     verifies that the deferred constants lacking a completion in the
--     private part of the same package are illegal.
--
--     The test also tests that is it illegal to declare a deferred constant
--     which is completed with a full constant declaration in private
--     parts and in package bodies. Note that the deferred constant itself
--     is legal (it could be completed with a pragma Import); it is the
--     presence of the full constant declaration that makes it illegal.
--
--     We don't test completions given in a body, as those would look
--     identical to completions that are missing altogether (tested by
--     B740001).
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B7400030.A
--         B7400031.A
--         B7400032.AM
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     Files B7400030.A and B7400031.A contain errors. All errors in
--     these files must be detected to pass the test.
--
--     Files B7400030.A and B7400031.A contain several lines
--     marked POSSIBLE ERROR: [Setn].
--     For each value of n, the implementation must detect one or more of
--     these possible errors. For instance, an error must be detected on
--     at least one of the lines labeled POSSIBLE ERROR: [Set1] for an
--     implementation to pass.
--
--     Compiling the main subprogram file B7400032.AM is optional.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      30 Apr 07  RLB   Created from ACATS 2.6 test.
--      17 Aug 07  RLB   Moved error indications based on implementer comments.
--      06 Sep 07  RLB   Added more flexibility in error indications.
--      29 May 08  RLB   Updated Pass/Fail criteria.
--      29 Jun 16  RLB   Fixed so tools don't pick up markers in criteria.
--      13 Jun 18  RLB   Updated Pass/Fail criteria to note that processing
--                       the last source file is optional (it is unnecessary
--                       to test the objective). Added error location
--                       indicators.
