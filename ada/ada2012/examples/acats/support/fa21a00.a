-- FOUNDATION DESCRIPTION:
--      This foundation declares various supporting types, objects, and
--      subprograms for use in tests checking preelaborability.
--
--      Types that do not have Preelaborable_Initialization are marked
--      "Not P_I".
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      20 Mar 95   SAIC    Initial prerelease version.
--      22 Mar 07   RLB     Ensured that the controlled type is not
--                          preelaborable. Marked types that do not have
--                          Preelaborable_Initialization.
