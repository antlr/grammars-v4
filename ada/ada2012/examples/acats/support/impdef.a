-- DESCRIPTION:
--     This package provides tailorable entities for a particular
--     implementation.  Each entity may be modified to suit the needs
--     of the implementation.  Default values are provided to act as
--     a guide.
--
--     The entities in this package are those which are used in at least
--     one core test. Entities which are used exclusively in tests for
--     annexes C-H are located in annex-specific child units of this package.

   -- Ada language-defined packages like Ada.Text_IO (from the Name
   -- function) and Ada.Directories, as well as from Report.Legal_File_Name.
   -- For instance, on Windows, the Ada runtime will probably use either
   -- '/' or '\', but probably not both, so it isn't necessary to implement
   -- that equivalence in this function.
