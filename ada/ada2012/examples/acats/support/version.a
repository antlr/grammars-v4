--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity

-- PURPOSE:
--     This package contains the version number of the ACATS, to be used in
--     ACATS output.
--
--     We make this a separate package so the version number can include the
--     ACATS Modification List identifier and thus change with each new List.
--     Since implementers are allowed to customize Report.A, leaving the
--     version number there would require redoing that customization with each
--     new ACATS Modification List. As a separate package, only this package
--     need change with each list.

--     29 Dec 2021  RLB  Created package.
--     29 Mar 2022  RLB  Issued ACATS Modification List 4.1Z.
--     30 Jun 2022  RLB  Issued ACATS Modification List 4.1AA.
