--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for an abstract generic formal derived type whose ancestor
--      type has an abstract primitive subprogram, non-abstract record and
--      private extensions of the formal derived type must override the
--      subprogram. Check that abstract record and private extensions need
--      not override the subprogram.
--
--      Check that, for a non-abstract generic formal derived type whose
--      ancestor type has an abstract primitive subprogram, record and
--      private extensions of the formal derived type need not override
--      the subprogram.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      If a formal derived type is declared abstract, it inherits the
--      abstract primitive subprograms of the ancestor type as abstract,
--      and non-abstract type extensions of the formal derived type must
--      override these subprograms.
--
--      If a formal derived type is not declared abstract, by definition it
--      does not have abstract primitive subprograms, even if the ancestor
--      type has abstract primitive subprograms. Thus any type extensions
--      of the formal derived type need not override anything.
--
--      This test checks that if a type extension of a formal derived type
--      inherits an abstract subprogram, it must either be declared abstract
--      or override the abstract subprogram. In particular, this is checked
--      for the case where the subprogram to be inherited is a procedure
--      which has been explicitly declared as abstract (the ancestor type
--      is thus abstract). Record extensions, and abstract and non-abstract
--      private extensions are checked. Cases are verified for both abstract
--      and non-abstract formal derived types.
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     This test contains several lines marked POSSIBLE ERROR: [Setnn].
--     For each value of n, the implementation must detect one or more of
--     these possible errors. For instance, an error must be detected on
--     at least one of the lines labeled POSSIBLE ERROR: [Set1] for an
--     implementation to pass.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      09 Nov 95   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.1 fixes: Changed two ERROR cases to
--                          OK. Eliminated resulting redundant cases.
--      11 Aug 96   SAIC    ACVC 2.1: Added optional ERROR comment to
--                          Private_Extension.
--      21 Nov 19   RLB     Added error location indicators.
