--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that the actual type passed to an abstract generic formal
--      private type may be either abstract or non-abstract, as may
--      record and private extensions of the formal type. Check that,
--      for a non-abstract type derived from an abstract formal private type,
--      all abstract primitive subprograms inherited from the actual type must
--      be overridden in the instance.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      The actual corresponding to an abstract formal type may be either
--      abstract or non-abstract. Record and private extensions of the formal
--      private type may be either abstract or non-abstract.
--
--      In an instance, all abstract primitive subprograms of the actual
--      type must be overridden for non-abstract extensions, as well as
--      any functions with a controlling result if the extensions are not
--      null extensions.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--
--         FC51C00.A
--      -> BC51C02.A
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      04 Mar 96   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.1 fixes: Moved all subprograms in
--                          PriExt_Overrides_Explicit and PriExt_Overrides_All
--                          from private to visible part. Added Func to private
--                          part of PriExt_Overrides_Explicit. Added
--                          commentary.
--      11 Aug 96   SAIC    ACVC 2.1: Updated prologue. Corrected position of
--                          ERROR comments.
--      01 Jun 98   EDS     Remove Function Func from private part of package
--                          PriExt_Overrides_Explicit.
--      22 Mar 07   RLB     Corrected to avoid problems with 3.9.3(4/2);
--                          updated terminology.
--      21 Nov 19   RLB     Added error location indicators.

package BC51C02_1 is

-- Check that a type derived from an abstract formal private type may be
-- either abstract or non-abstract.


-- Within each generic below, a non-abstract type is derived from the
-- formal type.
--
-- When each generic is instantiated with an abstract actual type, each of
-- the abstract primitive subprograms of the actual type must be overridden
-- for the derived type, or else the instantiation must be rejected.
-- Similarly, all functions with controlled results must be overridden
-- for the derived type.
--
-- Each of the generics below will be instantiated with the abstract type
-- FC51C00.Abstract_Child. Each generic overrides some set of the abstract
-- primitive subprograms of this actual type:
--
--     (1) *_No_Overrides does not override any of the primitive subprograms
--         of the actual.
--     (2) *_Overrides_Explicit only overrides the procedures which are
--         explicitly declared as abstract for the actual type; it does
--         not override the function with a controlling result.
--     (3) *_Overrides_All overrides all the abstract procedures inherited
--         as abstract from the actual, as well as the non-abstract function
--         which requires overriding when it is inherited from the actual.
--
-- For this test, the only generics for which an instantiation with the
-- abstract type FC51C00.Abstract_Child is legal are those in category (3).
