-- OBJECTIVE:
--
--     Check that Pre'Class and Post'Class cannot be specified on a subprogram
--     body that is acting as a completion.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     To test the objective, we check that Pre'Class and Post'Class cannot be
--     specified on subprogram bodies that are completing a subprogram
--     specification. But note that Pre'Class and Post'Class are allowed only
--     on primitive subprograms, and subprogram bodies are almost never
--     primitive. So even non-completing subprogram bodies cannot specify
--     Pre'Class or Post'Class. We've msrked cases that are illegal only
--     because they are not primitive with "Non-prim"; other test cases
--     test the objective (but also may be illegal by being non-primitive).
--
--     It is possible to have a subprogram body that is primitive and not
--     acting as a completion: it would have to override an inherited
--     primitive subprogram. So it would be possible to test a legal case;
--     however, such overriding is unlikely, especially as only one such
--     overriding is possible per type (since a body freezes the type).
--     This case is too unlikely to test.
--
--     We retain all of the non-primitive, non-completion bodies as this is
--     the only test that tries Pre'Class or Post'Class on subprogram bodies,
--     and it is worth verifying that those are rejected.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     04 Feb 2016   RLB   Created test.
--     28 Mar 2016   RLB   Added error location codes.
--     23 Sep 2022   RLB   Corrected test to mark all of the bodies as illegal.
