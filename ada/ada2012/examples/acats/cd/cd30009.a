--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that Component_Sizes that are multiples of the word
--      size are supported.
--
--      Check that for such Component_Sizes arrays contain no gaps between
--      components.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test defines three array types and specifies their layouts
--      using representation specifications for the 'Component_Size and
--      pragma Packs for each.  It then checks that the implied assumptions
--      about the resulting layout actually can be made.
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--      All implementations must attempt to compile this test.
--
--      For implementations validating against Systems Programming Annex (C):
--        this test must execute and report PASSED.
--
--      For implementations not validating against Annex C:
--        this test may report compile time errors at one or more points
--        indicated by "-- ANX-C RQMT", in which case it may be graded as
--        inapplicable. Otherwise, the test must execute and report PASSED.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      22 JUL 95   SAIC   Initial version
--      07 MAY 96   SAIC   Revised for 2.1
--      24 AUG 96   SAIC   Additional 2.1 revisions
--      16 FEB 98   EDS    Modify documentation.
--      02 DEC 15   RLB    Renamed test so it didn't refer to a non-existent
--                         subclause.
