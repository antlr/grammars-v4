--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that an abstract type derived from a tagged parent may override
--      primitive functions with controlling results as abstract.
--
--      Check that an abstract type derived from a tagged parent may not
--      override primitive functions with controlling results as not abstract.
--
--      Check that when a non-abstract or untagged type is derived from a
--      tagged parent with a primitive function returning a controlling
--      result, the function with the controlling result must be overridden.
--
--      Check that an abstract private type may not have a primitive abstract
--      subprogram if the full view of the type is not abstract.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test declares a non-abstract tagged type with a primitive
--      operation that is a function with a controlling result (e.g. a
--      result of the tagged type).  It makes legal and illegal
--      derivations from that type, where the issues of legality are based
--      on the presence or absence of an override for that function.
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--     The test contains several lines marked POSSIBLE ERROR: [Setnn].
--     For each value of n, the implementation must detect one or more of
--     these possible errors. For instance, an error must be detected on
--     at least one of the lines labeled POSSIBLE ERROR: [Set01] for an
--     implementation to pass.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      13 Jun 1995  SAIC   Initial version.
--      27 Mar 1996  SAIC   Modified error format.
--      17 Apr 1996  SAIC   Documentation, syntax repaired for 2.1.
--      21 Mar 2007  RLB    Corrected for Amendment 1 change to 3.9.3(4/2).
--       6 Mar 2014  RLB    Corrected to reflect AI05-0097-1, and add
--                          additional coverage to ensure that the original
--                          intent is also checked. Also improved error
--                          description for type T_3B, using Possible error
--                          rather than a comment.
--      26 Apr 2021  RLB    Added error location indicators.
