--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that when a non-abstract type is derived from a
--      tagged parent with a primitive function returning a controlling
--      access result, the function with the controlling access result
--      requires overriding.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      This test declares a non-abstract tagged type with a primitive
--      operation that is a function with a controlling access result (e.g. a
--      result an anonymous access designating the tagged type). It makes legal
--      and illegal derivations from that type, where the issues of legality
--      are based on the presence or absence of an override for that function.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      22 Oct 2007  RLB    Created from parts of existing test B393005.
--      26 Apr 2021  RLB    Added error location indicators.
