--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that, for P'Access of an access-to-subprogram type S, if the
--      subprogram denoted by P is declared within a generic body, S must
--      also be declared within the generic body.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      In order to satisfy accessibility requirements, the designated
--      subprogram P must be at the same or a less deep nesting level than the
--      access-to-subprogram type S -- P must "live" as long as S. Nesting
--      levels are the run-time nestings of masters: block statements;
--      subprogram, task, and entry bodies; and accept statements. Packages
--      are invisible to accessibility rules.
--
--      This test declares generic package and subprogram bodies in which
--      P'Access is utilized, and where the type of P'Access is:
--
--          (a) a type declared outside the generic.
--          (b) a formal type of the generic.
--          (c) a type declared within the generic declaration (package
--              case only).
--          (d) a type declared within the generic body.
--
--       The test verifies that cases (a)-(b) are illegal and cases (c)-(d)
--       are legal.
--
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      06 Dec 94   SAIC    ACVC 2.0
--      19 Apr 95   SAIC    Deleted maintenance comments in test objective.
--      02 Dec 95   SAIC    ACVC 2.0.1 fixes: Removed Acc_Outside case from
--                          Gen_Procedure, to avoid unintentional
--                          accessibility violation.
--      22 Jan 02   RLB     Commented out case (c), as it is legal by the
--                          interpretation in AI-229 (still under
--                          consideration).
--      14 Mar 07   RLB     Replaced case (c) as OK; it is clearly allowed
--                          by 3.10.2(32/2).
--      09 Feb 18   RLB     Removed tabs to bring into compliance with test
--                          standards. Added error location indicators.
