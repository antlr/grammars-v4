--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--
--     Check that the controlling parameter or controlling result cannot be an
--     incomplete view if the call is dynamically tagged.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--
--     We are checking 3.10.1(10.1/5). This rule was added by AI12-0155-1.
--     We cannot allow dispatching calls for an incomplete type as that
--     requires reading a component (the tag) of an object whose size and
--     layout is unknown.
--     
--     3.10.1(9.3/2) attempted to prevent this problem, but it's solution does
--     not work within a unit. Since Ada uses a linear elaboration model,
--     having the full declaration occurring later doesn't help. Neither does
--     the fact that any occurrence of this problem will always raise an
--     exception (Program_Error for call-before-body-elaboration). That's
--     because we have a language design principle that if a compiler has to
--     detect a case in order to avoid using non-existent information, then it
--     might as well reject it. See AARM 13.14(1.o-1.u).
--
--     We try these cases both for normal incomplete types and for incomplete
--     type with completions deferred to the body.
--
--     Note that this rule cannot be triggered by an incomplete view that comes
--     from a limited with, as there has to be a primitive function involved,
--     and primitive subprograms are not made visible by a limited with nor can
--     they be declared later.
--
--     Note: We have commented out the OK cases below. That was done as these
--     examples necessarily raise Program_Error and thus are not useful in
--     practice. Requiring compilers to correctly compile useless cases
--     violates the spirit of the ACATS.
