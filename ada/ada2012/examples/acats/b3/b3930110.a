--
-- OBJECTIVE
--
--    Check that an abstract routine of an abstract partial view overridden
--    by a non-abstract routine in the private part requires overriding when
--    it is inherited if the private part is not visible where it is inherited.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION
--
--    This test checks the case noted by AI05-0068-1. Whether a subprogram
--    requires overriding or is abstract can depend on the view of the
--    subprogram that is inherited.

-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> B3930110.A
--         B3930111.A
--         B3930112.A
--         B3930113.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Each of the files B3930111.A, B3930112.A, and B3930113.A contain errors.
--      All errors in all these files must be detected to pass the test; no
--      errors should be detected in file B3930110.A.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      05 Jan 2015   RLB   Created test, patterned after examples in
--                          AI05-0068-1.
