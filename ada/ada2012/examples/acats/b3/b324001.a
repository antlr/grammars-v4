--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that a predicate aspect must be of boolean type. Check that a
--     predicate may be given only on type and subtype declarations. Check
--     that a predicate may not be given on an incomplete subtype. Check
--     that a Static_Predicate must be predicate-static.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     Try various declarations that violate the rules. Detailed checks are
--     as follows:
--
--     (A) Non-boolean predicate expressions.
--     (B) Predicate aspect given on something other than a type or subtype
--         declaration.
--     (C) Predicate aspect given on a subtype of an incomplete type.
--     (D) Expression of a Static_Predicate containing a non-static function
--         call.
--     (E) Expression of a Static_Predicate containing a non-static call to
--         a arithmetic operator, including predefined operators operating
--         on the current instance.
--     (F) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a non-static membership whose
--         tested expression is not the current instance.
--     (G) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a membership where one or more
--         choices is non-static even when the tested expression is the current
--         instance.
--     (H) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a non-static case expression
--         whose tested expression is not the current instance.
--     (I) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a case expression where one or
--         more dependent_expressions is non-static even when the selecting
--         expression is the current instance.
--     (J) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a non-static call to a
--         predefined ordering or equality operator if neither operand is
--         the current instance.
--     (K) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a call to a predefined ordering
--         or equality operator where one operand is non-static even when the
--         other operand is the current instance.
--     (L) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a call to a predefined logical
--         operator if either operand is not predicate static.
--     (M) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a short circuit control form if
--         either operand is not predicate static.
--     (N) Expression of a Static_Predicate is a parenthesized expression if
--         the operand is not predicate static.
--     (Q) Expression of a Static_Predicate is non-static object.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      14 Jan 12   RAD     Initial version.
--      26 May 14   RLB     Split test into two parts, added test cases.
--      21 Apr 21   RLB     Added error location indicators.
