# Apex Grammar

## Source
"[Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm)
is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows
developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on
Salesforce servers in conjunction with calls to the API.
Using syntax that looks like Java and acts like database stored
procedures, Apex enables developers to add business logic to
most system events, including button clicks, related record updates,
and Visualforce pages. Apex code can be initiated by Web service
requests and from triggers on objects." [Apex Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm)

NB: This grammar uses the [Antlr4 tool and runtime](https://www.antlr.org/download.html)
for full Unicode code points and general categories.
Harwell's Antlr4cs alternative tool
and runtime for Antlr4 is an older version of Antlr4 that
does not support the Unicode feature. An older version of the grammar
is provided for back support.
