# MySQL Grammars

This folder contains MySQL grammars from different authors. See the specific sub folders for more details:

* [Oracle](Oracle) - A complete MySQL grammar including the latest language features of MySQL. This grammar is directly derived from the MySQL Yacc server grammar and is updated twice a year to stay in sync with the MySQL server enhancements. It supports all server versions starting from 8.0 and is driving the parsers in the [MySQL Shell for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.mysql-shell-for-vs-code). <br/>A **special feature** of this grammar is that you can switch the MySQL server version used at runtime, to adjust things like code completion and syntax checking for the server you are connected to. 
* [Positive Technologies](Positive-Technologies) - A grammar created from the official documentation (5.6, 5.7, 8.0)
