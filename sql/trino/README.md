# Trino grammar for ANTLR4

An ANTLR4 grammar for Trino, formerly known as PrestoSQL. This grammar is based on the actively maintained [Trino repository](https://github.com/trinodb/trino).

The lexer and parser are referenced from the [offical base antlr file](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/core/trino-parser/src/main/antlr4/io/trino/sql/parser/SqlBase.g4).
Changes are made to accomondate various language targets as the official one is being developed for Java only.

The examples are extracted from the [offical test file](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/core/trino-parser/src/test/java/io/trino/sql/parser/TestSqlParser.java).
