## Summary

This is the BASIC grammar from jvmBASIC, a BASIC to bytecode compiler.
It is very loosely based on Apple's [Integer Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC),
but attempts to include as much of the syntax of other BASIC variants as possible,
such as MS [GW-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW_BASIC).
