# Java9 Grammar

## Source
The source for the grammar is the
[Java Langauage Specification, version 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/index.html).
Please note that this grammar is unoptimized: the runtimes for parses will
be significantly slower than the [optimized Java grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/java/java).

## Examples
Several of these examples come from the OpenJDK and
Android runtime source code.
