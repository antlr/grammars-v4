# Java8 Grammar

## Source
The source for the grammar is the
[Java Langauage Specification, version 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/index.html).
Please note that this grammar is unoptimized: the runtimes for parses will
be significantly slower than the [optimized Java grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/java/java).

NB: The Antlr4cs grammar uses Harwell's Antlr4cs alternative tool
and runtime of Antlr4. It is an older version of the grammar
which supports Unicode input non-natively. 
The official Antlr4 tool and runtime support full Unicode code points
and general categories.
