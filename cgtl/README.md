This is the grammar and lexer for the CGTL (Concrete Grammar Transformation Language). 
CGTL is used to transform ASTs as produced by ANTLR, into any target textual language or documentation. 

It provides a quick way to build DSML tools and to do tasks such as program abstraction or program translation.
