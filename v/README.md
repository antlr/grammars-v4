# V Language grammar for ANTLR4
Because of the grammar similarity between Golang and V,

It's modified from `golang.g4`

Examples are all from [V language's official website](https://vlang.io)

## Known Issues:
- Because of the V is under early stage, its grammar is not so stable for now.

- some golang features are not completely removed in the `V.g4` file.
