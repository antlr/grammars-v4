# Ruby-like language grammar

## Overview

Ruby-like language (Corundum) grammar written in ANTLR v4. Was developed just for fun
to use with Parrot VM (basically it compiles into PIR - parrot intermediate
representation)

It has some specific stuff like inline pir and for loop :) And won't ever have
OOP features, sorry.
