# Amazon States Language Intrinsic Functions ANTLR4 Grammar

The ANTLR4 grammar for the Intrinsic Functions of Amazon States Language (ASL), initially developed by 
[LocalStack](github.com/localstack/localstack).

The module includes grammars (`ASLIntrinsicLexer.g4` and `ASLIntrinsicParser.g4`) for parsing intrinsic 
functions within ASL derivations.
