# A grammar for reStructuredText language written in ANTLR v4

## Source

[reStructuredText for ANTLR](https://github.com/lextm/restructuredtext-antlr)

## Overview

Here I just share a snapshot of its 0.9 release. You can find the latest release from the official repo. Issues and pull requests should also go to the official repo.

Note that the grammar does not include all processing logic (for example, for star and backtick related items). Those extra processing pieces are implemented in C#.
