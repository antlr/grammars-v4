#	THE FOLLOWING STORAGE IS TIME-SHARED BY MISSION PROGRAMS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MASTER COMTROL. IT IS
# ORGANIZED INTO THREE PARTS REFERRED TO AS A MEMORY, B MEMORY, AND C MEMORY. A PARTICULAR MISSION PHASE IS
# ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE SEGMENTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO OTHER MISSION PHASE USING THE SAME SEGMENT WILL EVER RUN
# CONCURRENTLY; E.G., RE-ENTRY WILL NEVER RUN CONCURRENT WITH TVC. THE NUMBER OF AREAS (3) IS DETERMINED BY THE
# MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DISTINCT MISSION PROGRAMS WHICH RUN SIMULTANEOUSLY.
#
#	A MEMORY IS USED BY NAVIGATION PROGRAMS; MID-COURSE DURING FREE-FALL PORTIONS OF THE MISSION AND 
# AVERAGE G INTEGRATION DURING ACCELERATED PHASES. GUIDANCE PROGRAMS SUCH AS TVC USE B MEMORY TOGETHER WITH THEIR 
# ASSOCIATED ALIGNMENTS. THE C MEMORY PORTION IS USED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE MISSION FOR THE MIDCOURSE ERROR
# TRANSITION MATRIX W, AND LATER BY RE-RENTRY AFTER THE LAST MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED. THE EXCEPTION IS
# SYSTEM TEST, ASSIGNED TO A MEMORY, WHICH NEVER RUNS CONCURRENTLY WITH MISSION PROGRAMS.
