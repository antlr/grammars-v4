# CodeQL Grammar
CodeQL grammar built from the [CodeQL Specification](https://codeql.github.com/docs/ql-language-reference/ql-language-specification/).

All test cases have been extracted from the [QL Language Reference](https://codeql.github.com/docs/ql-language-reference/) and slightly modified. It should be noted that some of these cases may contain semantic errors; however, the focus here is solely on verifying the correctness of the lexer and parser.
