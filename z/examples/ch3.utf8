A positive side-effect for being faithful to the
original source is that we do not need to worry
much about understanding the protocol. As it happens,
we learned it by osmosis!

\section{The abstract state}\label{ch3.abstractState}

\begin{LSDef}[Abstract purse]
‚îÄ AbPurse == [ balance , lost : ‚Ñï ] ‚îî ~\end{LSDef}

\subsection{A theory for purse names}\label{ch3.pursenames}

In the definition of the various structures that follows in Mondex,
a unique purse $NAME$ often appears. Another situation that often appears
is that sets involving names must be finite. Nevertheless, nothing about the
structure of $NAME$ is given. Thus, such assumed finiteness properties
cannot be proved (see $AuxWorld$ in Chapter~\ref{ch5}, $BetwFinState$ in Chapter~\ref{ch6},
and many others throughout the PRG).
\begin{LGSet}[Unique purse name]
‚îÄ [ NAME ] ‚îî ~\end{LGSet}
For instance, one of those finiteness assumptions comes from expressions such as
\begin{gzed}
   PayDetails ~~\defs~~ [~ from, to: NAME; \cdots | from \neq to ~]
   \\
   name: NAME \shows \{~ pd: PayDetails | pd.from = name ~\} \in \finset~PayDetails
\end{gzed}
Because this set comprehension expression represents a set of bindings, even
if the $from$ purse is fixed to a $name$, we could have an infinite number of
$to$ purses this $from$ purse is associated with. Therefore, we must introduce
further structuring for the unique purse names in order for the hidden finiteness
assumptions used throughout the PRG to hold. Luckily, they are fairly obvious and
abstract. We call it $NAMES$ and it could be defined as
\begin{gzed}
   NAMES \in \finset~NAME
\end{gzed}
Nevertheless, names are mostly use for characterising payment details between two
distinct (unique) purses. In fact, in Section~\ref{ch10.retrieve-value-mig-quant},
the existentially quantified equivalence of the retrieve relation partition is
provable only if there exists at least two different names.

Taking this into account, let us define at least two different known names.
This is also useful in order to prove the definition of $NAMES$ is consistent.
\begin{LNewADef}[Existence of distinct names]
‚ï∑ name1 , name2 : NAME |
 ¬¨ name1 = name2 ‚îî ~\end{LNewADef}
Next, we ensure that the definition of $NAMES$ we are about to introduce is
consistent.
\begin{LConsistency}[$NAMES$ definition existential consistency]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{tNamesExistentialConsistency}
    \exists NAMES: \finset_1~NAME @ \exists n1, n2: NAMES @ \lnot  n1 = n2
\end{theorem}~\end{LConsistency}
\begin{LConsistency}[$NAMES$ definition universal consistency]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{tNamesUniversalConsistency}
    \exists NAMES: \finset_1~NAME @ \forall n1: NAMES @ \exists n2: NAMES @ \lnot  n1 = n2
\end{theorem}~\end{LConsistency}
After proving those two theorems, we can then safely axiomatically define $NAMES$.
\begin{LNewADef}[Properties of unique purse names]
‚ï∑ NAMES : ùîΩ‚Üò1‚Üñ NAME |
 ‚àÉ n1 , n2 : NAMES ‚¶Å ¬¨ n1 = n2 
‚àÄ n1 : NAMES ‚¶Å ‚àÉ n2 : NAMES ‚¶Å ¬¨ n1 = n2 ‚îî ~\end{LNewADef}
With this structure model of names, we represent the finiteness assumptions
made throughout the PRG, as well as guarantee that payment transaction are
total.

\subsection*{Automation}

\begin{LRRT}[Every structured name belongs to the original $NAME$]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{rule rInNames}
    n \in NAMES \implies n \in NAME
\end{theorem}~\end{LRRT}

\begin{LToolkit}[Finite set weakening]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{rule rFiniteMember}[X]
    A \in \finset~X \implies A \in \power~X
\end{theorem}~\end{LToolkit}

The next theorem is an obvious conclusion from the declaration of $NAMES$ using $\finset_1$.
\begin{LNewLemma}[There exists at least one structured name]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{lExistsName}
    \exists name: NAMES @ true
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewLemma}

The next theorem is important to prove the finiteness (and existence)
of $PayDetails$, as at least two different names are required. That is,
we must have at least one distinct originator and receptor for any
authentic payment transaction to take place.
\begin{LNewLemma}[There exists two different names]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{lExistsDifferentNames}
    \exists n1, n2: NAMES @ \lnot n1 = n2
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewLemma}
Thus, structured names make payment transactions total, hence
always allows a payment to take place. Similarly, we sometimes know
one of the names and only assert the existence of the next one.

\begin{LNewLemma}[Given a name, there exists another distinct name]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{lExistsDifferentNameFromGivenName}
    \forall n1: NAMES @ \exists n2: NAMES @ \lnot n1 = n2
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewLemma}

\subsection{Finite space of numbers}\label{ch3.NAT}

Similarly, in order to make schemas finite as required,
we must also add a finite space of numbers by defining a
non-empty range over $\nat$, which is bounded by a $MAX\_NAT$
value defined as
\begin{LConsistency}[$NAT$ boundary consistency]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{tNATBoundaryConsistency}
   \exists MAX\_NAT: \nat @ true
\end{theorem}~\end{LConsistency}
\begin{LConsistency}[$NAT$ definition consistency]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{tNATDefinitionConsistency}
   \exists NAT: \power~(0 \upto MAX\_NAT) @ true
\end{theorem}~\end{LConsistency}

\begin{LNewADef}[Upper bound for $\nat$]
‚ï∑ MAX_NAT : ‚Ñï ‚îî ~\end{LNewADef}
\begin{LNewADef}[Bounded $\nat$]
‚îÄ NAT == 0 .. MAX_NAT ‚îî ~\end{LNewADef}

\subsection*{Automation}

Next, we add some trivial automation rules about these data types
in order to improve automation levels.
\begin{LGRT}[$MAX\_NAT$ maximal type]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{grule gMaxNatMaxType}
    MAX\_NAT \in  \num
\end{theorem}~\end{LGRT}
\begin{LGRT}[$MAX\_NAT$ type]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{grule gMaxNatNatType}
    MAX\_NAT \in  \nat
\end{theorem}~\end{LGRT}
\begin{LRRT}[$MAX\_NAT$ is a natural number (LHS)]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{rule rMaxNatType}
    MAX\_NAT \geq  0
\end{theorem}~\end{LRRT}
\begin{LRRT}[$MAX\_NAT$ is a natural number (RHS)]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{rule rMaxNatType2}
    0 \leq  MAX\_NAT
\end{theorem}~\end{LRRT}
This last rule is given just for the sake of
pattern matching on different scenarios, hence
making rules application smoother.

After that, we do the same for $NAT$.
\begin{LNewThm}[$NAT$ definition is consistent]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{tNATConsistency}
    \exists  n: NAT @ true
\end{theorem}~\end{LNewThm}

\begin{LRRT}[$NAT$ equivalence]
\begin{zeves-theorem}{rule rInNAT}
    x \in NAT \iff x \in \num \land x \geq 0 \land x \leq MAX\_NAT
\end{theorem}~\end{LRRT}

\subsection{Transfer details}\label{ch3.transferdetails}

Now, with the definition of the finite elements, we redefine
$TransferDetails$ to be finite. Note that because we leave
$AbPurse$ components unbound (as $\nat$), no additional proof
obligations when values are added to the $balance$ or $lost$ fields
are generated. We do not change $AbPurse$ to be bounded because
there is no requirement that it should be finite.

\subsubsection{Transfer okay TD}

The component $abAuhPurse$ is never directly initialised (as far as we could see).
Nevertheless, the retrieve relation from Chapter~\ref{ch10} establishes that
\begin{gzed}
 \dom~abAuthPurse = \dom~conAuthPurse
\end{gzed}
and in Chapter~\ref{ch6}, the range of $conAuthPurse$, but nothing is said about
its domain. In these circumstances, as $AbWorldSecureOp$ allows, some operation could
certainly remove $from?$ purse from the domain of $abAuthPurse'$, hence we need the
$\Delta Authentic$ below.

\begin{LSDef}[Successful secure transfer operation on abstract purses]

\subsubsection{Transfer lost TD}

We need the $\Delta Authentic$ here for $abAuthPurse' to?$,
because although no changes take place, it assumes $to?$ belongs
to the domain of $abAuthPurse'$.

\section{Summary}\label{ch3.summary}

We have substituted $NAME$ for $NAMES$ and $\nat$ for $NAT$ at various places
for the forementioned reasons. In here we provide the list where those changes
in declarations took place:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Chapter~3: $TransferDetails$, $AbWorld$, $Authentic$
   \item Chapter~4: $CounterPartyDetails$, $PayDetails$, $MESSAGE$, $ConPurse$
   \item Chapter~5: $Logbook$, $AuxWorld$, $PhiBOp$, $Ignore$, $AuthoriseExLogClearOkay$, $Archive$
   \item Chapter~6: $BetwInitIn$
   \item Chapter~7: $PhiCOp$, $CIgnore$, $CArchive$
   \item Chapter~8: $BetweenOpSig$, $ConOpSig$
\end{itemize}
Obviously, the theorems involved in these definitions are somewhat affected, but we
tried to keep to the minimum possible. Moreover, because of the limit on the maximal
values, we need added preconditions for the concrete world operations, precisely:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Chapter~4: $StartFromPurseEafromOkay$, $StartToPurseEafromOkay$.
   \item Chapter~8: corresponding (4) theorems for the added change in Chapter~4.
\end{itemize}
Maybe $AbWorld.abAuthPurse$ do no need $NAMES$.
$ConWorld.conAuthPurse$, $PhiBOp.names?$, $Ignore.names?$, $AuthoriseExLogClearOkay.names?$
need $NAMES$ due to the relationship with $Logbook$ and the $archive$.
