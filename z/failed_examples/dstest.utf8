We start by testing the $InitDS$ schema.

─ ⊢? ⦉ file′ == ⟨ ⟩ ⦊ ∈ InitDS └ 
\vspace{-6ex}
─ ⊢? ⦉ file′ == ⟨ 3 ⟩ ⦊ ∉ InitDS └ 

For $readFILE$, we design a set of positive tests that all work
on the same input file contents, $eg1$.  So when writing the set of tests,
it is convenient to use the schema calculus to factor out the 
unchanging $file, file'$ from the other test values.
─ eg1 == ⟨ 1 , 255 ⟩ └ ─ dsPos == [ file == eg1 ; file′ == eg1 ] ∧ { ⦉ offset? == 0 , length? == 0 , data! == ⟨ ⟩ ⦊ , ⦉ offset? == 0 , length? == 3 , data! == ⟨ 1 , 255 ⟩ ⦊ , ⦉ offset? == 1 , length? == 1 , data! == ⟨ 1 ⟩ ⦊ , ⦉ offset? == 3 , length? == 2 , data! == ⟨ 0 , 0 ⟩ ⦊ } └ 

─ ⊢? dsPos ⊆ readFILE └ 

Here is the output from ZLive when we use its \texttt{conjectures}
command to evaluate all the conjectures in this $dstest$
section.\footnote{We have added the conjecture names into the ZLive output
by hand in this example, but hope to automate this in the future.
The problem is that the Z standard currently does not pass the
conjecture names from the \LaTeX\ markup to the Unicode markup, so
getting access to the names within the parser and ZLive will require
some extensions to the Z standard, which we have not yet made.}

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
dstest> conjectures
Conjecture on line 7 (InitDSEmpty)
true
Conjecture on line 11 (InitDSNot3)
true
Conjecture on line 29 (readFILEPos)
false
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

To investigate the failing conjecture~$readFILEPos$ on line~29, we ask
ZLive to evaluate $dsPos \setminus readFILE$.  This displays just the
test vectors that are not members of $readFILE$, which tells us that
the third and fourth tests failed.  For each of these, we investigate
why it failed by using the ZLive `\texttt{do}' command to search for
any solution to the $readFILE$ schema with the given input values.
For the third test, we get this output: \begin{small} \begin{verbatim}
dstest> do [readFILE | file=eg1; offset?=1; length?=1] \end{verbatim}
\vskip -3ex \[ 1: \lblot file == \{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 255 ) \}, file'
== \{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 255 ) \} , \\ \t1 offset? == 1 , length? == 1
, data! == \{ ( 1 , 255 ) \} \rblot \] \end{small} Oops, this test
should have had 255 in $data!$ rather than $1$, because in POSIX,
$offset?=1$ refers to the \emph{second} byte of the file.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
dstest> do [readFILE | file=eg1; offset?=3; length?=2]
\end{verbatim}
\vskip -3ex
\[
1: \lblot file == \{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 255 ) \},
 file' == \{ ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 255 ) \} , \\
 \t1 offset? == 3 , length? == 2 , data! == \{ \} \rblot
\]
\end{small}
Ah, of course!  Reading past the end of the file should return empty
$data!$, rather than zeroes.  (When designing this fourth test, Mark was 
incorrectly thinking of the behaviour of the Write command past the end
of the file, which inserts zeroes automatically.) 
Once these two errors in the expected output values are corrected,
all tests give true.


\subsection{Negative Tests for $readFILE$}

Our first two negative tests check that $\negate 1$ is not a valid
input for $offset?$ or $length?$.  In the latter test ($ReadNotLenNeg$),
we show how we can write the test values inside the $readFILE$ schema, 
which can sometimes be more convenient.

─ ⊢? ( [ offset? == - 1 ] ∧ readFILE ) = { } └ 

\vspace{-3ex}
─ ⊢? [ readFILE | length? = - 1 ] = { } └ 

The remaining negative tests are partially specified, so each
conjecture actually checks a set of negative test tuples.  The
$ReadNoChange$ test checks that the read operation does not
change the contents of our example file $eg1$.  The
$ReadNotLonger$ test checks that the output $data!$ is
never longer than the contents of file $eg1$.  This is actually
proving that the property $\# data! > 2$ is false for all lengths $0
\upto 3$, which is a form of finite proof by exhaustive enumeration.

─ ⊢? [ readFILE | file = eg1 ; file′ ≠ eg1 ] = { } └ 
\vspace{-6ex}
─ ⊢? [ readFILE | file = eg1 ; offset? = 0 ; length? < 4 ; # data! > 2 ] = { } └ 

This illustrates that there is a continuum between testing and proof.
We usually test just one input-output tuple at a time, but the idea of
testing can be extended (as in this paper) to allow a given property
to be evaluated for all members of a finite/small set.  This is
similar to model-checking, where properties of finite systems are
proved by exhaustive enumeration.  Animators like ZLive use a mixture
of symbolic manipulation techniques and exhaustive enumeration.  The
more they use symbolic manipulation, the closer they become to general
theorem provers.  So the testing-proof continuum ranges from testing
of single input-output tuples, through enumeration (or 
model-checking) of finite systems, to full symbolic proof.



We can write positive and negative unit tests for the $writeFile$
operation in a similar way to $readFile$, but space does not permit us
to show the details of this.
