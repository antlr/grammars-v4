# HTTP Grammar

An ANTLR4 grammar for [HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230).
This grammar is based on the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 7230, RFC 7231)
and closely follows
the [ABNF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#appendix-B) format.

Currently, the grammar is incomplete and only supports the request line and
headers.
