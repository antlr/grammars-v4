McKeeman Form is a notation for expressing grammars. It was proposed by Bill McKeeman of Dartmouth College. It is a simplified Backus-Naur Form with significant whitespace and minimal use of metacharacters.

`McKeemanForm.g4` is ported from original McKeeman Form format (`examples/mckeeman.txt`) with some modification (use `?`, remove some recursion) to reduce parse tree depth.
