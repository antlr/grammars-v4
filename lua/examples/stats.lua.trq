(: Check whether there are a correct number of "stat".

    NB!!! This is a placeholder to implement a requirement on
    the number of stat-nodes. This is known to be incorrect for
    the current version of the lua grammar. When tree structure
    is corrected, this file must be fixed.

    For now, the count is 2.
:)

assert count(//stat) = 2, "Invalid number of 'stat' nodes.";
